# PowerShell-Cybersecurity-VRS
# Vale Rocha's Cybersecurity Repository

Welcome! This is my personal repository for career-related materials.

Here, I’ll be uploading everything I encounter in my Cybersecurity class. The goal is to create a centralized space for everything I’ve learned so far—both as a personal archive and as a way to share my progress.

The initial files include the first exercises we completed in class and at home. These cover basic tasks designed to help us get familiar with PowerShell, PowerShell ISE, and virtual machine environments. You’ll also find some basic analysis of my system’s data (which has now been anonymized).
